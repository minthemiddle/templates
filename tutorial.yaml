prompt: |
  Create a tutorial for the given input.
  
  Rules:
  
  1.  Focus on the learner's experience, providing a meaningful, achievable task, not just explanations.
  2.  Deliver visible, comprehensible results early and often, to build confidence and connections.
  3.  Maintain a clear narrative of expected outcomes, guiding the learner and highlighting key observations.
  4.  Encourage repetition and 'the feeling of doing' to reinforce skills and knowledge.
  5.  Minimize explanations, focusing on concrete steps and directing learners to further information as needed, rather than during the task.
